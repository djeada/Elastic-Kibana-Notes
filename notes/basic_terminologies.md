## Basic Terminologies

- A cluster is a collection of one or more nodes (servers) that work together to store and manage your data, providing indexing and search capabilities across all nodes. The cluster coordinates data distribution and load balancing, ensuring fault tolerance and scalability. A typical Elasticsearch setup has at least one cluster, often named by default as "elasticsearch."
- A node is a single server within your cluster that stores a portion of your data and handles indexing and searching tasks. Nodes can be configured to serve different roles, such as data storage (data nodes), cluster management (master nodes), or performing complex search operations (ingest nodes). Each node connects to others in the cluster to share resources and workload.
- An index is a collection of documents with similar characteristics, structured to facilitate search and retrieval. In an e-commerce context, for example, an index might represent product listings, while in a log management scenario, it could represent logs for a specific application. Indexes are identified by names and are divided into smaller segments, known as shards, for efficient storage and retrieval.
- A document is the basic unit of information that can be indexed and retrieved. Each document is a JSON object that represents a real-world entity, like a single product in an e-commerce index or a single log entry in an application log index. Documents have fields (key-value pairs) that represent their properties and are stored in one or more indexes.
- A shard is a subdivided piece of an index. Each shard is a fully functional, independent "index" that can be distributed across different nodes within a cluster. Sharding enables Elasticsearch to handle larger datasets by distributing the data across multiple nodes and supporting parallel processing, improving both performance and fault tolerance.
- Replica shards are additional copies of primary shards within an index. Each replica shard is identical to a primary shard and exists to increase data redundancy and improve availability. In the event of a primary shard or node failure, replica shards ensure data remains accessible and queries can still be executed without interruption. By default, Elasticsearch assigns one replica per primary shard, but this can be customized for higher fault tolerance.
